        <p>I like to do art and craft because Arts and craft activities help instil a sense of achievement and pride , boosting our confidence. The opportunity to create whatever I desires helps foster creativity.I will learn to make correct and effective decisions by facing and solving artistic challenges.Through arts and craft, I learn to value and appreciate artifacts and images across cultures and times.I learn to act and think like designers and artists, working intelligently and creatively.I also learn about the preservation of heritage through art. A lot of the information we have now about people that lived millions of years ago came solely from art.I learn about new colors and shapes through arts and crafts as well as gains familiarity with various figures and patterns.Arts and crafts not only help in the above traits but also in boosting academic performance.</p>

    <h1>MANDALA ART</h1><br><h2>A mandala is a spiritual and ritual symbol in Asian cultures. It can be understood in two different ways: externally as a visual representation of the universe or internally as a guide for several practices that take place in many Asian traditions, including meditation. In Hinduism and Buddhism, the belief is that by entering the mandala and proceeding towards its center, you are guided through the cosmic process of transforming the universe from one of suffering into one of joy and happiness.
